PostNotes.
**************

This is a simple application created to take notes.

* it was built using jQuery(JavaScript library, Bootstrap, Html and Css).

* it uses localStorage as a means to save, retrieve, update and delete notes thereby performing a CRUD operation.

* it offers a simple form of validation that ensures that users cannot just send empty fields as inputs and expect it to be saved.

* it completely saves the titles, texts and dates for each note created at a particular time.

* it runs the full functionalities of bootstrap & jQuery without connection to the internet but all that is needed is a great browser.

* tested on Firefox, Chrome and Safari browsers.


**************
Enjoy !.
